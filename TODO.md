# TODO: Update Machinery Cards with Images

- [ ] Modify `renderMachineryCard` method in `scripts/machinery.js` to use background image from `machine.image` field
- [ ] Add gradient overlay inside `.machinery-img` for text readability
- [ ] Position icon and machine name at the bottom of the image area with flex-end alignment
- [ ] Ensure image area has fixed height (220px) and cover/center positioning
- [ ] Retain existing `.machinery-info` section without changes
- [x] Test the updated cards to ensure images load correctly and overlays work
- [x] Verify responsiveness and accessibility
